Amaury Boller [made significant progress](https://github.com/yoda1490/banhammer):

> I've updated this to work with OpenStreetMap as Google now ask credit card to use their API. I Also added some libs like Jquery/Bootstrap to improve the style and make it compatible with smartphones Also implemented a country layer and colorized them regarding the number of attacks

I have now implemented this to work with SQLite3, building upon the great work Amaury did.

This is tested and working with PHP 8.3, SQLite3.
